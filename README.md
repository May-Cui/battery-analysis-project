## Project Overview

This project investigates four diagnostic methods for lithium-ion battery degradation:  
- Differential Capacity Analysis (**dQ/dV**)  
- Differential Voltage Analysis (**dV/dQ**)  
- Differential Coulometry Spectroscopy (**DCS**)  
- Differential Power‚ÄìEnergy Analysis (**dP/dE**)

### Methodological Notes

1. **From DCS to LEAN**  
   The work initially started with the **Differential Coulometry Spectroscopy (DCS)** method, following the BioLogic application note ([Application Note #57](https://www.biologic.net/documents/dcs-battery-application-note-57/)).  
   Later in the literature review, I came across the **LEAN method** proposed by **Feng et al., 2020** ([link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590116820300084)), which can be understood as a *normalised version* of DCS.  
   Since LEAN provides mathematically stable and comparable outputs across cells, the final comparative study was conducted using **LEAN together with dQ/dV, dV/dQ, and dP/dE**.  

2. **Interpolation vs. Downsampling**  
   In the early stages, I implemented both **interpolation-based** and **filtering/downsampling-based** re-sampling strategies.  
   - With dense datasets, both routes produced similar results.  
   - However, interpolation effectively ‚Äúcreates‚Äù points and should only be used for sparse/uneven data, while modern best practice is **downsampling** to preserve fidelity.  
   - All poster figures and main results therefore used the **downsampling + LEAN** route.  

   For reproducibility:  
   - **`40_pipeline_all_methods.ipynb`** ‚Üí final unified pipeline (downsampling + LEAN, used in poster).  
   - **`30_pipeline_interpolation_dcs.ipynb`** ‚Üí alternative interpolation + DCS route (kept for exploration).
