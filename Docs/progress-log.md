# Week 1  
Date: 30 June â€“ 6 July 2025

## Summary of Work Completed

- Set up `FUSE_env` and GitHub repository structure.
- Followed the Cui et al. (2024) notebook using the provided half-cell and full-cell files.
- Created `Exploring_cui2024_halfcell_fitting.ipynb` to reproduce SOC alignment and `dV/dQ` analysis. Ran and debugged multiple times to understand each processing step and output.
- Reproduced plots using the two referenced data files. Began reviewing related papers to interpret the plot features and investigate the rationale behind file selection.
- Used helper functions directly from the notebook. Spent time tracing inputs/outputs and exploring how they might be reused or adapted.
- Drafted `dvdq_explained.md` with planned structure and notes for each section.
- Maintained:
  - `battery-terminology.md` (technical glossary)  
  - `Analysis-techs.md` (overview of four core diagnostic methods)  
  - `paper_summary.md` (summaries and questions raised)  
  - `progress-log.md` (this file)

## Planned for Week 2

- Investigate the origin and structure of the two example files.
- Apply `dV/dQ` to a new dataset (e.g. Joule 2024).
- Begin simplified implementation of the method.
- Explore PyProBE in parallel.
- Prepare notebooks for `dQ/dV`, `DCS`, and `dP/dE`.
- Finalise glossary and method summaries.
- Attempt charge/discharge segmentation as outlined in the suggested project plan.
