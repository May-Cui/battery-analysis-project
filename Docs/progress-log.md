## Summary of Work Completed

- Set up `FUSE_env` and GitHub repository structure.
- Followed the Cui et al. (2024) notebook using the provided half-cell and full-cell files.
- Created `Exploring_cui2024_halfcell_fitting.ipynb` to reproduce SOC alignment and `dV/dQ` analysis. Ran and debugged multiple times to understand each processing step and output.

- Used helper functions directly from the notebook. Spent time tracing inputs/outputs and exploring how they might be reused or adapted.
- Drafted `dvdq_explained.md` with planned structure and notes for each section.
- Maintained:
  - `battery-terminology.md` (technical glossary)  
  - `Analysis-techs.md` (overview of four core diagnostic methods)

# Week 2  
Date: 7 July – 13 July 2025

## Summary of Work Completed

- Created `extract_qv_from_raw_216.ipynb` to process a set of raw formation data (`Nova_Formation-216.csv`) from Cui et al. (2024), extract clean charge Q–V segments, and visualise capacity-voltage relationships.  
  Applied interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing, and gradient calculation to generate `dV/dQ` plots for Cell 216 and explored how smoothing and x-axis choices affected the curve features.
- Built a clean and generalised implementation of the `dV/dQ` pipeline in `analyze_dvdq.ipynb`, separating logic from testing and preparing for batch processing or extension to other datasets.  
  While developing this, I referred to Cui et al.’s `DVF_functions.py` script for structural ideas related to differential voltage analysis—particularly how they handled interpolation, Savitzky-Golay filtering, and gradient computation. I adapted these methods to work directly with raw full-cell aging data, as my focus is on implementing and comparing differential diagnostic techniques rather than reconstructing full-cell curves from half-cell measurements.
- Structured the method documentation in `dvdq_explained.md`, explaining the purpose, implementation, and interpretation of `dV/dQ` analysis, along with technical notes on interpolation and differentiation.
- Based on supervisor suggestion, began applying the pipeline to a second dataset (McMaster, Anselma et al., 2021) to explore cross-dataset applicability of differential analysis methods.  
  Reproduced V–Q and `dV/dQ` plots for one cell at a single mileage point.  
  This dataset was selected in part because it was compiled into a single, well-structured Excel file, making it straightforward to load and apply the same pipeline directly.  
  I first plotted the V–Q curve for a cell from the McMaster dataset and visually compared it to the corresponding result published in the Anselma et al. (2021) paper, confirming consistency.  
  Since the paper did not include any differential diagnostic plots (e.g., `dV/dQ`, `dQ/dV`), I proceeded to apply my own `dV/dQ` analysis to the same cell at that mileage point, as an initial exploration of degradation-related features.
- Maintained:
  - `battery-terminology.md` (technical glossary)
  - `dvdq_explained.md` (in-depth method notes)  
  - `paper_summary.md` (summaries and questions raised)  
  - `progress-log.md` (this file)

# Week 3  
Date: 14 July – 20 July 2025

## Summary of Work Completed

- Used and extended the general pipeline in `analyse_dvdq.ipynb` (created in Week 2) to support further analysis and adaptation to the Borealis dataset.

- Created `explore_Borealis_dqdv.ipynb` to inspect the Borealis “03 - CONSTANT CURRENT” dataset structure and test charge/discharge segmentation using current polarity.  
  Explored file formats, segmentation logic, and Q–V plotting to prepare for batch implementation.

- Built a refactored notebook `analyse_Borealis_dqdv.ipynb` to apply the general pipeline to Borealis data in a clean, reproducible manner.  
  Integrated smoothing, interpolation, and automated derivative plotting; implemented logic to save computed results alongside original columns.

- Investigated how the dataset’s original `dV/dQ` and `dQ/dV` columns were generated by testing:
  - Gradients on raw voltage–capacity data;
  - Gradients on smoothed (non-interpolated) data;
  - Gradients on interpolated + smoothed curves.  
  The computed results matched the **shapes** but not the **values** of the original dataset curves, suggesting they were likely generated using on-device firmware logic.

- Pushed the following notebooks to GitHub:
  - `analyse_dvdq.ipynb` (created in Week 2, finalised this week)  
  - `explore_Borealis_dqdv.ipynb`  
  - `analyse_Borealis_dqdv.ipynb`  
  - `extract_qv_from_raw_216.ipynb` (finished in Week 2, pushed this week for completeness)

- Maintained:
  - `battery-terminology.md` (technical glossary)  
  - `dvdq_explained.md` (in-depth method notes)  
  - `paper_summary.md` (summaries and questions raised)  
  - `progress-log.md` (this file)

# Week 4
Date: 21 July – 27 July 2025  

---

## Summary of Work Completed
- Finalised ```differential_analyse_Borealis.ipynb```: added optional saving of plots, standardised discharge curve direction (ensuring visually decreasing voltage and negative derivatives), and investigated how parameter choices affect outputs.
- Completed full implementation of `dV/dQ` and `dQ/dV`, including batch data preprocessing, gradient calculation, and plotting.  
- Created a new notebook for exploring multicycle plotting (`explore_multicycle_plot.ipynb`); finalised with consistent legends and formatting for poster usage.  
- Refactored code into modular functions with more flexible parameters for easier reuse across methods; all code now integrated into a new notebook (`utils_dev_testing.ipynb`), to be transferred to `.py` once fully tested, if needed.  
- Cleaned and renamed functions and files for clarity and consistency.  
- Continued reading papers to prepare for the upcoming method comparison work.

# Week 5  
Date: 28 July – 3 August 2025  

---

## Summary of Work Completed  
- Met with supervisor to review analysis methods; clarified column provenance in Borealis dataset and confirmed that given `P`, `E`, `Q` values are reliable (from a published paper), so they can be directly used for analysis.  
- Worked extensively on `utils_dev_testing.ipynb` to develop a unified analysis pipeline across all diagnostic methods (`dV/dQ`, `dQ/dV`, `dP/dE`, `DCS`):  
  - Used dataset-provided variables (`P`, `E`, `Q`) as inputs.  
  - Applied method-specific interpolation (`V(Q)`, `Q(V)`, `P(E)`), followed by Savitzky–Golay smoothing and numerical differentiation.  
  - Planned final interpolation of all differential results with respect to voltage for aligned comparison.  
- Standardised and re-implemented `dV/dQ` and `dQ/dV` in `utils_dev_testing.ipynb` with consistent preprocessing and smoothing logic.  
- Started integrating `dP/dE` and `DCS` using the same modular structure.  
- Began preparing for future multicycle comparisons by reviewing peak alignment logic and testing updated plotting functions.

# Week 6

---

## Summary of Work Completed  
- Completed full implementation of all four diagnostic methods (`dV/dQ`, `dQ/dV`, `dP/dE`, `DCS`) within the unified pipeline.  
- Adapted the Faraday FUSE poster template into sections tailored to the project’s structure and goals.  
- Created a detailed plan of required plots for the poster based on the first draft of the introduction section.  
- Implemented the planned plots in `utils_dev_testing.ipynb` using Python.  
- Discussed with supervisor regarding section structure, plot styles, and overall poster design approach.  
- Began targeted literature review to support method comparison and provide references for poster content, building on initial reading from earlier weeks.  
- Continued drafting sections on project motivation, comparative insights, and key findings for the poster.
