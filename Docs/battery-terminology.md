# Battery Terminology Glossary

## Capacity  
Total electric charge a battery can store. Measured in mAh or Ah.

## State of Charge (SoC)  
Indicates remaining charge, expressed as a percentage (0â€“100%).

## C-rate  
Rate of charge/discharge. 1C means full charge or discharge in 1 hour.

## CCCV (Constant Current Constant Voltage)  
Charging method: first constant current, then constant voltage.

## Coulombic Efficiency (CE)  
Ratio of discharge capacity to charge capacity. Ideal is 100%.

## Calendar Aging  
Degradation over time during storage, even without use.

## Cycle Life  
Number of full charge/discharge cycles before capacity drops to ~80%.

## Thermal Runaway  
Dangerous overheating loop that can lead to fire or explosion.
