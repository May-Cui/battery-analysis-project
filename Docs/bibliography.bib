  abstract = {Three 2.5Ah LFP battery cells are cycled until they reached a very low SOH (70\% for the 300k km case, 40\% for the 206k km case, and 15\% for the 95k km case). The tests begin with an HPPC test and two repeated 1C discharge tests, which are followed by 300 repetitions of a power profile calculated for an HEV following the WLTP drive cycle. Each aging case has a different power profile, which is designed based off of an empirical aging model to acheive approximately 95,000 km, 206,000 km, or 300,000 km of driving before the cell ages to 80\% SOH. One possible application of the dataset could be parameterizing/training and testing SOC or SOH estimation models for hybrid electric vehicles. Since there are three cases which age at a different rate, two cases could be used to train a machine learning algorithm and the third case could be used to test it, for example. For full details regarding the design of the tests see the Applied Energy paper "Battery state-of-health sensitive energy management of hybrid electric vehicles: Lifetime prediction and ageing experimental validation".},

  abstract = {Achieving a satisfactory high-voltage battery lifetime while preserving fuel economy is a key challenge in the design of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). While several battery state-of-health (SOH) sensitive control approaches for HEVs have been presented in the literature, these approaches have not typically been experimentally validated. This paper thus aims at illustrating an optimal, multi-objective battery SOH sensitive off-line HEV control approach, which is based on dynamic programming (DP) and is experimentally validated in terms of prediction capability of the battery lifetime. An experimental campaign is conducted which ages cells with current profiles for three different predicted lifetime cases. The predictive accuracy of the battery ageing model is subsequently improved by including the effect of temperature and updating the empirical ageing characterization curve. The improved ageing model is then used to assess HEV performance in terms of fuel economy and battery lifetime for various high-voltage battery pack sizes and control goals. Results suggest that, thanks to the proposed multi-objective battery SOH sensitive control approach, the battery pack may be downsized by 35\% with no impact on battery lifetime and a fuel consumption increase of just 1.1\%. Engineers and designers could thus potentially adopt the proposed control approach to design HEVs which take tradeoffs between fuel economy and battery lifetime into consideration. Considerable reductions in battery pack cost, weight and production related CO2 emissions could be achieved in this way.},

Battey performance is degrades with battery aging and therefore a battery diagnostics and prognostics tool to enhance the effective use of the battery system is necessary. This paper deals with some challenges that remain unsolved in battery diagnostic and prognostic techniques. A review of recent battery diagnostic approaches for battery state estimation is performed and their relative advantages and disadvantages are emphasized while comparing the available methods to predict the battery end of life (EOL) or remaining useful life (RUL) as a key tool in battery prognostics.},

  abstract = {Degradation in lithium ion (Li-ion) battery cells is the result of a complex interplay of a host of different physical and chemical mechanisms. The measurable, physical effects of these degradation mechanisms on the cell can be summarised in terms of three degradation modes, namely loss of lithium inventory, loss of active positive electrode material and loss of active negative electrode material. The different degradation modes are assumed to have unique and measurable effects on the open circuit voltage (OCV) of Li-ion cells and electrodes. The presumptive nature and extent of these effects has so far been based on logical arguments rather than experimental proof. This work presents, for the first time, experimental evidence supporting the widely reported degradation modes by means of tests conducted on coin cells, engineered to include different, known amounts of lithium inventory and active electrode material. Moreover, the general theory behind the effects of degradation modes on the OCV of cells and electrodes is refined and a diagnostic algorithm is devised, which allows the identification and quantification of the nature and extent of each degradation mode in Li-ion cells at any point in their service lives, by fitting the cells' OCV.},

Using half-cell data, the peaks in the dV/dQ curve of the full cell data were assigned. Analysis of the relative peak shifts allowed for the determination of the source of capacity fade. For cells formed and aged at 45°C for 40 weeks (capacity fade = 7.5\%), the analysis indicated negligible loss of accessible material at the anode and at the cathode. Capacity loss of the cell could be accounted for, largely, by side reactions at the anode. This type of analysis can be used when the introduction of a reference electrode is difficult or impractical.},

  abstract = {Incremental capacity (IC) and differential voltage (DV) analyses are effective for monitoring battery health, however, the diagnosis often requires considerable parameterisation efforts and a low scan rate. In this work, a simple-to-parameterise quantitative diagnostic approach is presented, which differentiates between loss of lithium inventory and loss of active materials in the anode and cathode. With an open-circuit voltage model and a genetic algorithm optimisation routine, peak signatures in voltage and capacity differentials are used to quantify degradation modes as opposed to traditional approaches of matching the whole voltage and capacity spectra. The outputs are validated with synthetic IC-DV spectra and achieve a low root-mean-square error of ± 2.0 \%. A similar level of accuracy is achieved when heterogeneity is introduced in the synthetic degradation data and also with partial discharge data. Experiments from pouch cells under 5 C discharge and 0.3 C charge cycling at 25 °C and 45 °C, together with post-mortem measurements, confirm the accuracy of this approach with diagnosis scan taken at 0.3 C. The IC-DV peak-tracking quantitative diagnostic code demonstrates a reliable and easy-to-implement means of extracting deeper insights into battery degradation and is shared alongside this manuscript to help academia and industry develop better lifetime predictions.},

Finally, a set of complete synthetic degradation maps for the most common commercially available chemistries will be provided and discussed to serve as guide for future studies.},

  abstract = {The growing market of electrified vehicles requires efforts from car manufacturers to build robust systems to deal with all types of situations their products will face in customers’ hands. A major system of electrified vehicles is the energy storage unit. The complexity of batteries lies in their nonlinear behaviour that is highly dependent on external factors such as temperature and load dynamics. To handle these conditions, the battery management system relies on algorithms that estimate the state of the storage unit. State of charge (SOC) estimation, which is widely studied in industry and academia, is commonly considered one of the most significant functions of a battery management system (BMS). State of health (SOH) estimation is likewise important as it is necessary to support more consistent SOC and state of power (SOP) estimation. In this paper, a dual Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF) model is proposed to estimate the battery state of charge and capacity state of health across the battery lifespan. The DEKF model is demonstrated to accurately estimate SOC as the battery ages, with an average RMS error of 1.0\% for SOH varying from 100\% to 80\%. The model is also shown to be robust against initial SOC and sensor error, demonstrating its applicability to real world conditions.},

We report the realization of an accurate and reproducible approach, as “Level Evaluation ANalysis” or LEAN method, to diagnose the battery degradation based on counting the number of points at each sampling level, of which the accuracy and reproducibility is proven by mathematical arguments. Its reliability is verified to be consistent with previously published data from four laboratories around the world. The simple code, exact fitting, consistent outcome, computational availability and reliability make the LEAN method promising for vehicular application in both the big data analysis on the cloud and the online battery monitoring, supporting the intelligent management of power sources for autonomous vehicles.},

Each cell type undergoes five different aging methods, encompassing calendar aging, cyclic aging and a realistic drive cycle profile. Differential voltage analysis is employed as a non-destructive technique to gain insights into degradation modes of the aged cells. The findings suggest that in the cells equipped with nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathodes and graphite/silicon anodes, the primary aging mechanism involves growth of the solid electrolyte interface. Conversely, cells incorporating nickel-cobalt-manganese cathodes with a higher silicon content in the anode, experience a notable loss in anode capacity. The obtained results from electrochemical tests are validated through post mortem analysis including scanning electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry, computed tomography, and coin cell measurements. Through material characterisation analysis, differential voltage analysis proves to be a reliable, non-invasive method for aging investigation.},

The increase of dU/dQ is an early indicator of upcoming heat events and deep discharge. The criterion dQ/dU = dU/dQ = 1 could serve as an indicator for “full charge”. The frequency response of capacitance correlates with the available charge of the battery and reflects overcharge events and deep discharges long before the battery fails. It is not necessary to measure down to extremely low frequencies because the charge transfer pseudocapacitance of around 10 Hz reflects well the SOC. Computer-aided calculation methods for the evaluation of measurements in industrial environments and for the training of students are presented.},

  abstract = {Physics-based electrochemical models of lithium-ion cells require knowledge of electrode open-circuit potential (OCP) as a function of stoichiometry. To determine the OCP relationships for a cell built from unknown active materials, we might run low-rate constant-current laboratory tests on half cells built from harvested electrodes to collect related discharge and charge data. However, processing data from these tests must overcome three problems: the “data-quality problem,” the “missing-data problem,” and the “inaccessible-lithium problem.” This paper introduces a simple histogram-based method to overcome the data-quality problem and compares five different approaches to overcome the missing-data and inaccessible-lithium problems. These methods rely in part on a physics-based thermodynamic model for multiple-species multiple-reaction (MSMR) systems, which is flexible enough to accommodate different cell chemistries and simple enough to be utilized in real-time battery management systems. The five methods are validated in simulations and are then applied to physical half-cell data to produce OCP estimates for graphite and NMC electrodes from a commercial cell.},

  abstract = {Degradation of Lithium-ion batteries is a complex process that is caused by a variety of mechanisms. For simplicity, ageing mechanisms are often grouped into three degradation modes (DMs): conductivity loss (CL), loss of active material (LAM) and loss of lithium inventory (LLI). State of Health (SoH) is typically the parameter used by the Battery Management System (BMS) to quantify battery degradation based on the decrease in capacity and the increase in resistance. However, the definition of SoH within a BMS does not currently include an indication of the underlying DMs causing the degradation. Previous studies have analysed the effects of the DMs using incremental capacity and differential voltage (IC-DV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The aim of this study is to compare IC-DV and EIS on the same data set to evaluate if both techniques provide similar insights into the causes of battery degradation. For an experimental case of parallelized cells aged differently, the effects due to LAM and LLI were found to be the most pertinent, outlining that both techniques are correlated. This approach can be further implemented within a BMS to quantify the causes of battery ageing which would support battery lifetime control strategies and future battery designs.},

  abstract = {Savitzky–Golay (SG) filtering, based on local least-squares fitting of the data by polynomials, is a popular method for smoothing data and calculations of derivatives of noisy data. At frequencies above the cutoff, SG filters have poor noise suppression; this unnecessarily reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, especially when calculating derivatives of the data. In addition, SG filtering near the boundaries of the data range is prone to artifacts, which are especially strong when using SG filters for calculating derivatives of the data. We show how these disadvantages can be avoided while keeping the advantageous properties of SG filters. We present two classes of finite impulse response (FIR) filters with substantially improved frequency response: (i) SG filters with fitting weights in the shape of a window function and (ii) convolution kernels based on the sinc function with a Gaussian-like window function and additional corrections for improving the frequency response in the passband (modified sinc kernel). Compared with standard SG filters, the only price to pay for the improvement is a moderate increase in the kernel size. Smoothing at the boundaries of the data can be improved with a non-FIR method, the Whittaker–Henderson smoother, or by linear extrapolation of the data, followed by convolution with a modified sinc kernel, and we show that the latter is preferable in most cases. We provide computer programs and equations for the smoothing parameters of these smoothers when used as plug-in replacements for SG filters and describe how to choose smoothing parameters to preserve peak heights in spectra.},

  abstract = {State of health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction are crucial for battery management systems (BMS). However, accurate SOH and RUL prediction still need to be improved due to the complicated battery aging mechanism. This work combines incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA) based on the second-order RC model with an improved Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) to develop SOH and RUL prediction framework. Firstly, the voltage is reconstructed through the second-order RC model to obtain the incremental capacity (IC) and differential voltage (DV) curves to avoid the influence of measurement noise and the complex parameter adjustment process in the filtering method on the IC and DV curves. Then, a new set of battery aging features are extracted from the reshaped IC and DV curves to improve SOH and RUL prediction accuracy and robustness. Next, the BiGRU method with attention mechanism (BiGRU-AM) is used to build the prediction models for battery aging features, SOH, and RUL. To reduce the impact of the capacity regeneration phenomenon, the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) method is used to decompose the SOH prediction results, and the decomposed residual is used as the input to improve the prediction accuracy of RUL. The uncertainty of RUL prediction results is analyzed by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Finally, the proposed method is verified by experimental battery data from Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) and Sandia National Laboratory. Experimental results show that the voltage reconstruction results based on the second-order RC model are applied to ICA and DVA analysis, effectively avoiding the influence of noise. The RMSE of voltage reconstruction is within 0.0006, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between the four aging features extracted from the reconstructed IC/DV curve and SOH is above 0.9. Moreover, this method has good robustness to the cell inconsistency, temperature uncertainty, and a satisfied generalization ability to different battery chemistries, which the maximum RUL predicted AE of CALCE and Sandia battery is within 10 and 5, respectively.},

  abstract = {Differential voltage analysis (DVA) is a non-destructive method for analyzing the degradation mechanisms of lithium-ion batteries and is widely used. The capacity variations between the peaks on the differential voltage curves are considered to reflect different degradation mechanisms of the batteries. However, DVA of batteries is the coupling of cathodes and anodes, and is based on idealized assumptions that still require experimental validation and correction. Due to the challenges in fabricating long-term and reliable reference electrodes for commercial batteries, it is hard to decouple the cathode and anode over the battery entire lifespan. In this study, four types of three-electrode batteries are fabricated. The cycling aging experiments are conducted on the three-electrode batteries, decoupling the voltages of the cathode and anode over the entire battery lifespan. The DVA method is validated and corrected. The corrected DVA, combined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy based on reference electrodes, is used to analyze and quantify the battery degradation mechanisms. The degradation mechanisms of 36.3~\% loss of lithium inventory, 7.8~\% loss of active material (LAM) for anode, and severe LAM for cathode are identified. Finally, the degradation mechanisms are validated by post-mortem analysis. This study provides valuable insights and guidance for the use of DVA and the future commercial three-electrode batteries in battery diagnosis and prognosis.},

This paper investigates the incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA) methods for onboard battery SOC and capacity estimation. Since the conventional cell terminal voltage based ICA/DVA methods are sensitive to the changed battery resistance and polarization during battery aging processes, the SOC based ICA/DVA methods are proposed to address this problem as so to accurately identify features of interest on incremental capacity (IC) and differential voltage (DV) curves for applications. Three feature points (FPs) that are potential to be easily identified by battery management systems are extracted from the SOC based IC/DV curves, and then the relations between FPs and cell SOCs/capacities are quantified and applied for battery SOC and capacity estimation. The robustness of the proposed approach against various aging levels and erroneous cumulative capacities is evaluated. Promising results with the maximum absolute error of 1.0\% and the relative error of 2.0\% can be achieved for battery SOC and capacity estimation, respectively.},
